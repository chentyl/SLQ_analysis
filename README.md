## Instructions

To generate figures run `python make_figs.py`. All figures should be generated in 15-20 minutes.

Note that the two files in `data/` are generated using a slightly modified version of PyHessian. Generating these files takes a significant amount of time, so we have included them for convenience. 


## Repository Contents
